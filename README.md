##### Making spaces talk: A practical introduction to electronics and programming.

Democratization of technology previously limited to the specialized industries is enabling a new approach towards how we
understand digital technology in architecture and design. Thanks to open source communities such as Arduino and Processing 
we are moving from sketching ideas towards building real prototypes and testing them with real users. Prototyping does not just mean
technology it is also a new way of understanding how we design and make things.

The seminar will be an introduction to the principles of electronics and programming. From using sensors for logging data about
the environment to controlling interactive lights and robots using the Internet. We will follow a practical approach, starting from
simple examples and working in teams, we will design and build the public spaces of tomorrow, connecting citizens with their environment.
